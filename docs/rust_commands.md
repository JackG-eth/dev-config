## Additional RustLsp Commands

These aren't mapped to keybindings but can be run with `:RustLsp <command>`:

| Command | Description |

| `:RustLsp moveItem up` | Move item up |
| `:RustLsp moveItem down` | Move item down |
| `:RustLsp hover actions` | Show hover actions |
| `:RustLsp hover range` | Show hover for range |
| `:RustLsp crateGraph` | View crate graph |
| `:RustLsp syntaxTree` | View syntax tree |
| `:RustLsp flyCheck` | Run fly check |
| `:RustLsp view hir` | View HIR (High-level IR) |
| `:RustLsp view mir` | View MIR (Mid-level IR) |

## Common Workflows

### Running Code
1. Press `<leader>rr` to open the runnables picker
2. Select:
   - **Run** - Execute the current file/function
   - **Test** - Run tests
   - **Debug** - Start debugging session

### Managing Dependencies
1. Open `Cargo.toml`
2. Place cursor on a crate line (e.g., `serde = "1.0"`)
3. Press `<leader>Cv` to see available versions
4. Press `<leader>Cu` to update to selected version
5. Press `<leader>Ca` to update all crates at once

### Debugging Errors
1. Place cursor on an error or warning
2. Press `<leader>re` to get a detailed explanation
3. Press `<leader>rD` to see the full diagnostic with context
4. Press `<leader>a` to see available code actions/fixes

### Refactoring
1. Place cursor on variable/function name
2. Press `grn` to rename across entire project
3. Press `<leader>a` to see available refactorings (extract function, inline, etc.)

### Navigating Code
1. Press `grd` to jump to definition
2. Press `grr` to find all references
3. Press `gri` to see implementations
4. Press `<C-t>` to jump back

### Working with Macros
1. Place cursor inside a macro invocation
2. Press `<leader>rm` to expand it recursively
3. See the generated code

## Pro Tips

- **Discovery**: Press `<leader>` and wait - which-key will show all available commands
- **Context-aware**: `<leader>rr` shows different options based on context (binary, test, example, etc.)
- **Cargo.toml**: Hover over any crate name and use `<leader>C` commands
- **Inlay hints**: Toggle with `<leader>th` to see type hints inline
- **Quick docs**: Press `K` twice to jump into the hover window for better reading

## Troubleshooting

**LSP not working?**
- Run `:LspInfo` to check if rust-analyzer is attached
- Run `:Mason` to ensure rust-analyzer is installed

**Crates commands not working?**
- Make sure you're in a `Cargo.toml` file
- Run `:Lazy` to verify crates.nvim is installed

**Want to add custom keybindings?**
- Edit `after/ftplugin/rust.lua` to add your own mappings
